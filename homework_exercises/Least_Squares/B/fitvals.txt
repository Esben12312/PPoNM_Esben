The covariance-matrix is:

   0.00101  -0.000108 
 -0.000108   1.62e-05 

 lambda is fitted to a value of 0.172070796448845 +/- 0.00402918677701604
This corresponds to a half-life of 4.02826740426003 +/- 0.0162306417595292 days
half-life tabulated at 3.63 days uncertainties unknown
The estimated uncertainties illustrates a large discrepancy from the tabulated half-life
